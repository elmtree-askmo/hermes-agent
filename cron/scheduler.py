# Artemis B-0510-01 Phase 4b — post-LLM semantic voice-scan.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Phase 3's _scan_briefing_anti_patterns relies on literal substring markers,
# which miss third-person voice violations using recipient first names or
# paraphrased pronoun structures (Amy "if Amy responds", Crystal "her CS + SWE
# positioning"). Phase 4b adds a semantic check: a small LLM call to
# google/gemini-3-flash-preview (configurable) judges whether the briefing
# addresses its reader in second person or narrates about them in third
# person. Fail-open on any error — the scan is an enforcement layer, not the
# primary defense.
#
# Phase 5 (2026-05-19) extends the judge to a DUAL VERDICT — voice axis
# (unchanged) + structure axis (new). Structure axis catches A-class
# reasoning leaks: the model emitting its planning narration ("Now let me
# construct...", "Key facts:", "Format:", "Let me build it.") instead of, or
# preceded by, the actual deliverable. Phase 1's F template and Phase 3's
# marker list both missed Maggie 5/18 and Elva 5/19 prod A-class regressions
# — same root cause as Phase 4b's B-class miss (enumeration is structurally
# insufficient). One LLM call, two independent verdicts. Either FAIL → run
# fallback. Bench evidence: logs/bench/voice-scan-phase5-2026-05-19.md
# (gemini-3-flash-preview 10/10 voice + 10/10 structure, ~2.2s, ~$0.0003).

_VOICE_SCAN_PROMPT = """You are auditing a Coach's daily briefing for a single user before delivery.

The briefing is judged on TWO INDEPENDENT axes:

================================================================
AXIS 1 — VOICE
================================================================
The briefing must be in SECOND PERSON ("you / your") when referring to the recipient.

A voice violation is when the briefing uses THIRD PERSON to refer to the recipient — either by name (e.g. "if Amy responds" when Amy IS the recipient) or by pronoun ("she / he / her / his / they" / "the user") when the pronoun refers to the recipient.

Third-party names (events, companies, other people) are NOT violations even if they are proper nouns. Only the recipient being named/pronouned in third person counts.

Examples of voice violations:
- "if Amy responds" (recipient=Amy)
- "Crystal's positioning" (recipient=Crystal)
- "she reaches out" (referring to recipient)
- "Maggie's bandwidth is the blocker" (recipient=Maggie)
- "the user is 11 days post-graduation" (third-person "the user" referring to recipient)

Examples of OK voice:
- "let me know if you're going" (second person)
- "Women in Tech SF on 5/21" (third-party event)
- "AIET 2026 in Zagreb" (event name)
- "Andiamo role" (company name)

================================================================
AXIS 2 — STRUCTURE
================================================================
The briefing must be a DELIVERABLE addressed to the user, not the LLM's internal planning narration about how it intends to write the briefing.

A structure violation is when the briefing contains:
(a) Planning narration — the model talking to itself about what it's going to produce. Signals: "Now let me construct ...", "Let me build it.", "Let me compose it ...", "Key facts:", "Format:", "Status is ..." (as a leading sentence stating the model's own situation read), "I should send ...", "The strategic playbook is ..." followed by self-instruction.
(b) The deliverable being entirely replaced by the planning (no Coach's Take, no Follow-ups block, no quiet-day note actually addressed to the user).
(c) The deliverable being preceded by planning narration (even if a clean deliverable appears later in the text). The user should never see the model's internal thinking before the deliverable.

A quiet-day note counts as a valid deliverable as long as it stands alone without planning prefix. Example of acceptable quiet-day deliverable: "Nothing urgent on the board today — I'll keep scanning in the background."

Examples of structure violations:
- "Now let me construct the briefing. Key facts: ..." (planning, not deliverable)
- A briefing that opens with "The status is no_resume — no resume on file..." then later contains a clean quiet-day note (planning prefix before deliverable)
- A briefing that opens with "I'll skip New Roles entirely. Garwin is in acute ambiguity fatigue." then a Follow-ups block (planning prefix before deliverable)

Examples of OK structure:
- Opens directly with a sentence addressed to the user, followed by Follow-ups block + Coach's Take.
- Quiet-day note that addresses the user from the first word.

# Artemis S-0511-07 — briefing-output persistence (scheduler-side write).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# After _deliver_result succeeds for an artemis-briefing job, persist the
# exact delivered text (LLM draft OR guard-substituted fallback) so Artemis
# Coach can replay sections of the briefing on S2 ask without re-running the
# cron. The file shape matches the artemis MCP tool `save_briefing_output`'s
# write format — both writers share the storage layout, both readers (Coach
# S2 via MCP `get_recent_briefings`, retro analysis scripts) consume the
# same shape.
#
# Why scheduler-side and not LLM-side: the cron LLM has one final response
# that IS the deliverable, no second turn for a post-delivery tool call.
# The scheduler is also the only party that knows what was actually
# delivered (LLM draft vs. guard fallback). See Artemis S-0511-07 spec
# § Architecture for the full rationale.
#
# Failure handling: try/except swallows any persistence error, logs at WARN,
# and falls through to mark_job_run unchanged. A missing persisted entry
# means the next day's run produces a fresh one; the user has already
# received the briefing.
