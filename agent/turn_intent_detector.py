"""User-turn intent detector (S-0518-01 direction B).

Auxiliary LLM-driven classifier that runs BEFORE Coach's turn begins. Reads
the user's most recent inbound message and decides whether it's an
artifact-deliverable request that should route through a sub-agent
(Type E in `docs/research/2026-05-21-subagent-appearance-taxonomy.md`).

When the user is asking for a saveable, structured artifact (cheat sheet,
draft text, list, framework, summary, comparison) — i.e. work that should
become a backend artifact owned by Scout / Analyst / Publicist rather than
Coach prose — this returns a hint that `gateway/session.py` injects into
the Coach system prompt as a `<detected-intent>` block. Coach then has an
unambiguous server-provided cue to enqueue + announce instead of inlining
the answer.

Same pattern as the existing `pending-announcements` injection that
handles Confirm leg (Type D): server pre-computes the decision, Coach LLM
only follows the guidance. This compresses Coach's freedom on the one
remaining type that requires Coach-side semantic judgment.

**Failures are silent.** Auxiliary call timeout, LLM not configured, parse
failure → return empty result; Coach proceeds normally without the hint.

You are a routing classifier for a career-coaching agent. A user just sent
a message. Decide whether the user is asking for a *saveable, structured
artifact* that should be authored by a backend sub-agent (Scout / Analyst /
Publicist), NOT inlined into Coach's conversational reply.

The sub-agents:
- **Scout** — market scanning, role discovery, company / event lookups
- **Analyst** — data analysis, interpretation, comparisons, frameworks,
  hiring-pattern synthesis, cheat sheets of facts/figures
- **Publicist** — draft text the user will send/use: cover letters,
  resumes, outreach messages, follow-ups, bios

Route to a sub-agent when the user is asking for something they would
**want to save / reference / send later** — a deliverable artifact, not a
conversational answer.

Examples that ROUTE:
- "can you make me a cheat sheet for those metrics?" → analyst
- "draft a follow-up email to Sarah" → publicist
- "what roles are open in NYC for entry-level marketing?" → scout
- "compare these two job descriptions" → analyst
- "write me a cold-outreach line for that recruiter" → publicist

Examples that DO NOT route (Coach handles inline):
- "what do you think of my situation?" → emotional / advice
- "should I take the offer?" → decision-prompting
- "i feel stuck" → emotional
- "yes" / "go for it" / "makes sense" → confirmation
- "what is engagement rate?" → conceptual question with a one-line answer
- "how are you?" → conversational

Return STRICT JSON, no prose, no markdown fence:

{
  "route_to_subagent": <true|false>,
  "sub_agent": "<scout|analyst|publicist|null>",
  "suggested_action": "<one-line verb+object describing the artifact, e.g. 'Draft metrics cheat sheet for next interview prep'. Null if route_to_subagent=false>",
